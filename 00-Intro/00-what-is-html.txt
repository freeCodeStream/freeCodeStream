What is HTML?

HTML: HyperText Markup Language
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the 
meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used
to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

Key Terminology:

HyperText:
"HyperText" refers to the ability to link to other resources on the web, such as other pages,
documents, or images. These links are called hyperlinks, which are a core feature of the web.


Markup Language:
HTML uses special tags to "mark up" text, meaning it adds instructions that tell the browser how
to display the content. 
For example, <h1> marks a headline, and <p> marks a paragraph.


"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website
or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to
the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant
in the World Wide Web.

HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.
HTML markup includes special "elements" such as
    <head>
    <title>
    <body>
    <header>
    <footer>
    <article>
    <section> 
    <p>
    <div>
    <span>
    <img> 
    <aside>
    <audio>
    <canvas>
    <datalist>
    <details> 
    <embed>
    <nav>
    <search>
    <output>
    <progress>
    <video>
    <ul>
    <ol> 
    <li> and many others.

An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element
name surrounded by '<' and '>'. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is,
it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be
written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice
is to write tags in lowercase.




1. Why is HTML Important?
HTML is the foundation of every website you visit. Without it, there would be no websites, just raw
data. It tells the web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) what content to show and how it should be
structured.


2. The Role of HTML in Web Development
Web development typically involves three main technologies working together:

  HTML (Structure):
  Defines the structure of the web page. It organizes the content into elements like headings,
  paragraphs, images, and links.

  CSS (Styling):
  Stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to style and visually design the page.
  For example, you can change colors, fonts, and layouts.

  JavaScript (Interactivity):
  Adds dynamic behavior to web pages, like dropdown menus, animations, and form validations.


3. How HTML Works in Practice:

Browser Rendering:
When you type a URL into a browser, it retrieves the HTML file from a server and displays the page.
The browser reads the HTML code and translates it into what you see (text, images, etc.).

Structure and Accessibility:
HTML ensures content is well-organized and accessible. For example, screen readers for visually
impaired users rely on correctly written HTML to describe a web page.

Letâ€™s Look at an Example:
Below is a simple HTML document:

==================================

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text on my first web page!</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
  </body>
</html>

==================================

Here is Explanation of the code:
<!DOCTYPE html>: Tells the browser which HTML version is used.
<html>: The root element, it contains all the HTML content.
<head>: Contains metadata like the title of the page.
<title>: Sets the page title shown in the browser tab.
<body>: Contains the visible content of the page.
<h1>: A headline.
<p>: A paragraph of text.
<a>: A hyperlink that links to another page.
