How the Web Works

The web is an essential part of our daily lives, yet many people use it without understanding how 
it actually works. At its core, the web operates on a concept known as the client-server model. 
This model forms the foundation of how computers communicate over the internet to deliver the 
webpages, apps, and services we use every day.

1. The Client-Server Model: An Overview
This model is a method of communication between two types of computers:

Clients:
Devices like your laptop, smartphone, or tablet. A client is responsible for initiating a request
for data or services.

Servers:
Computers that store and manage data, applications, or resources. A server listens for requests
from clients and responds with the necessary data or service.

To visualize this, imagine a customer (client) ordering food in a restaurant and the kitchen
(server) preparing and serving it. The customer requests something, and the kitchen fulfills that
request.

2. Key Components of the Model

Clients:
Devices used by end-users.
Run applications like web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Generate requests for resources, such as web pages, images, or videos.

Servers:
Dedicated machines or services that respond to client requests. Host resources like websites
(e.g. a news site or e-commerce platform) and make them available to clients.

The Network:
The medium through which clients and servers communicate, typically the internet. Typically Use 
protocols (rules) like HTTP or HTTPS to exchange information.

3. A Simple Example: Visiting a Website
When you type a web address (e.g., www.example.com) into your browser, several steps happen almost
instantly. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

The Request:
Your browser (the client) sends a request to the server associated with the web address.
This request is made using the HTTP protocol (HyperText Transfer Protocol). If security is needed,
it uses HTTPS, which encrypts the communication.

Finding the Server:
Your request first passes through a system called DNS (Domain Name System). DNS translates
the human-readable web address (www.example.com) into an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1), which
identifies the server on the internet.


The Server Responds:
The server receives your request, processes it, and sends back the required data such as an HTML
file, CSS, JavaScript, images or additional files if required.

Rendering the Web Page:
Your browser takes the data from the server and assembles it into the webpage you see. For example,
the HTML provides the structure, CSS handles the design, and JavaScript enables dynamic elements
like buttons or animations.
